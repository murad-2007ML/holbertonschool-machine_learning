    network - the model to train
    data - ndarray of shape (m, nx) containing the input data
    labels - one-hot ndarray of chape (m, classes) containing labels of data
    batch_size - is the size of the batch used for mini-batch gradient descent
    epochs - the number of passes through data for mini-batch gradient descent
    verbose - the boolean that determines if output should be printed

    shuffle - a boolean that determines whether to shullfe batches every epoch
    Normally, it is a good idea to shuffle, but for reproducibility, 
    we have chosen to set the default to False
